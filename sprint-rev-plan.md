# SPRINT REVIEW/PLAN! 

## Today I am getting better one teensy step at a time

## It's also a Sprint Review/Reflect/Planning Day! 

### Sprint Review: 

- last week was 3.5/5 because I was consistent with building a daily habit, but I didn't do as much as I would have liked 

what went right? what additional things did I do that I'd like to celebrate?
- I did SOMETHING each day! 
- I maintained a balance of excitement/obsession
- I kept track of my progress 
- set up Google Voice for Intangible Insights
- worked on the Intangible Insights website
- read a lot of HTMA and a little of Tufte

what could've gone better? 
  - I think I would like to have gone deeper with my tasks
  - I notice that I really enjoy reading and learning from books. I will do this by printing off my material/downloading it on my kindle so that I feel like its a book 
  
what will I do better next sprint?
  - I think if I move up my time to 8:30 that would be the best thing! Then I can start my learning each morning and evening at that time and go a bit longer in the day without being affected by fatigue or distraction
  - I can also put the amount of time I estimate for each task 


### SPRINT PLAN:
    For this week, I will prioritize the following: 

SMART GOALS: 

> Learn for at least 1 hour each day starting at 8:30 AM and/or 8:30 PM 

> Prepare for the Google Analytics Exam and choose a date & time to take the exam

> Complete 50% of the Excel Course for Data Analysis 

> Next Steps meeting with Uplift, GBA 

OK Great! So for today, here are my focused tasks: 

- [x] Practice Markdown/git  (10)
- [x] Google Analytics (10)
- [x] Excel Course (40)
- [x] Reading (+30)
