day_2

Wild day, already! 

I had a problem commiting my file
So I used git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
which really didn't help...
so then I decided to just delet the local repo and re-clone the remote 

FIXED! 

Then I realized I accidentally deleted day_1 by saving over it (lol)
    *one number , oops

So then, I learned how to Stash a Change in the local (while I went to the Master branch)
I discover day_1 still present there
SO... I discarded the changes 
  AND THEN MAGIC HAPPENED...

  The code that was open (for day_2) changed BACK to day_1 becuase I never committed the changes
  for this journal entry, and my file that was open was called day_1

  Magic Tech!

  Ok, anyway, so for Day 2...
